# MyToken Smart Contract Readme

## Overview

The MyToken smart contract is an Ethereum-based token contract written in Solidity. This contract implements the basic functionalities of creating, minting, and burning tokens. This README provides an overview of the contract, its functions, and usage.

## Contract Details

### Token Properties

- **Token Name**: "Solidity"
- **Token Abbreviation**: "sol"
- **Total Supply**: 0 (initially)

### Balances

This contract maintains a mapping of Ethereum addresses to their token balances. The balances are public and can be accessed using the `balances` mapping.

### Mint Function

The `mint` function allows for the creation of new tokens. It increases the total token supply and the balance of the specified address. The function takes two parameters: an Ethereum address and a value to mint.

Example Usage:
```solidity
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
    // Increases total supply by _value
    totalSupply += _value;
    // Increases the balance of _address by _value
    balances[_address] += _value; 
}
```

### Burn Function

The `burn` function allows for the destruction of tokens. It decreases the total token supply and the balance of the specified address. The function takes two parameters: an Ethereum address and a value to burn. It includes conditional checks to ensure that the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the amount to be burned.

Example Usage:
```solidity
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
    // Check if the balance of _address is greater than or equal to _value
    if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
        // Decreases total supply by _value
        totalSupply -= _value;
        // Decreases the balance of _address by _value
        balances[_address] -= _value;
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

To deploy and use the MyToken contract, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Remix or Truffle.

2. Interact with the contract using a tool like MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, or Ethereum development libraries.

3. You can mint tokens by calling the `mint` function, providing the recipient's address and the amount to mint.

4. You can burn tokens by calling the `burn` function, providing the sender's address and the amount to burn. Ensure that the sender has a sufficient balance to execute this operation.

## License

This contract is open-source and released under the MIT License. You are free to use and modify it according to your needs. Please make sure to understand the Ethereum gas costs associated with minting and burning tokens.
